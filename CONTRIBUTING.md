# Contributing guidelines
Before directly contributing, first discuss your proposed changes through Gitter, or add an issue. Don't add a pull request before doing so.

We openly welcome anything - we're fine with constructive critiscism, crazy feature request, and the correction of a single character!
After all, the more contributions a project receives (no matter how big or small), the faster it develops.

## Issues
Therefore, you can file issues about practically anything. However, you must:
* Add as much description as possible, however small the change.
* Not use hateful language.
* Not include anything completely unrelated (e.g. advertising your repository).
* Use the template provided, as applicable.

## Pull requests
When adding a pull request, always update the CHANGELOG.md file to show the changes you've made, using the existing format.
* Use descriptive language, and explain everything you're adding.
* Update the version number in package.json to represent the version that your addition would be working towards.
* Prepare to actively discuss changes - stay online for at least a couple of minutes after adding a pull request to see and reply to comments and questions.
* Ensure that the Travis build succeeds.

That's it! Please contribute...
