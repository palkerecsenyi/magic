### Setup
To set up Magical Library, place `magic.css` (or `magic.min.css` for a minified file) and the `fonts` folder into the same directory on your website, and link it using
```HTML
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/magic.css">
```
You can also install Magic using NPM:
```bash
npm install magical-css
```

### Usage
Magical Library tries to avoid default styles (globally referencing elements rather than classes) wherever possible, to make it as non-destructive in complex projects as possible. Class names are designed to be very evident. For a full usage guide, see the Wiki of this repository.

### Attributions
Two fonts are used: `Noto Sans` by Google and `Roboto` by Christian Robertson.

### Documentation
To use Magic, you'll need to read the official documentation. It's currently available through Github pages at https://palkerecsenyi.github.io/magic/docs/. The documentation is, in fact, made with Magic!

That's it. Enjoy!
