# Magical Library
...is a simple CSS library for building stylish interactive websites.
It's licensed under GNU GNP 3, so you can change it as much as you like.

### Setup
To set up Magical Library, place `standard.css` and the `fonts` folder into the same directory on your website, and link it using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/magiclib.css"`. That's it.

### Usage
Magical Library tries to avoid default styles (globally referencing elements rather than classes) wherever possible, to make it as non-destructive in complex projects as possible. Class names are designed to be very evident. For a full usage guide, see the Wiki of this repository.

### Attributions
Two fonts are used: `Noto Sans` by Google and `Roboto` by Christian Robertson.

### Documentation
To use Magic, you'll need to read the official documentation. It's currently available on this repository's Wiki, at https://github.com/palkerecsenyi/magiclib/wiki

That's it. Enjoy!
